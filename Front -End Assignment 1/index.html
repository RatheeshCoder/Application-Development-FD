            <h3>About the Legend</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full
                    Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,
                    was born on October 15, 1931, in
                    Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.
                </li>
                <li> He served as the 11th President
                    of India from 2002 to 2007.
                </li>
                <li>Kalam earned a degree in
                    aeronautical engineering from the
                    Madras Institute of Technology and in
                    1958 joined the Defence Research and
                    Development Organisation (DRDO).
                </li>
                <li> In 1969, he moved to the Indian
                    Space Research Organisation, where he
                    was project director of the SLV-III, the
                    first satellite launch vehicle that was
                    both designed and produced in India.
                </li>
                <li>Rejoining DRDO in 1982,
                    Kalam planned the program that produced
                    a number of successful missiles, which
                    helped earn him the nickname
                  <strong>“Missile Man.”</strong>  
                </li>
                <li>. Among those successes
                    was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
                    ballistic missile, which incorporated
                    aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
                    in 1989.
                </li>
                <li>He also played a
                    pivotal organisational, technical,
                    and political role in India's Pokhran-II
                    nuclear tests in 1998, the first since
                    the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
                </li>
                <li> From 1992 to 1997 Kalam
                    was scientific adviser to the defense
                    minister, and he later served as principal
                    scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the
                    government with the rank of cabinet minister.
                </li>
                <li>His prominent role in
                    the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
                    solidified India as a nuclear power and
                    established Kalam as a national hero,
                    although the tests caused great concern
                    in the international community.
                </li>
                <li> In 1998 Kalam put
                    forward a countrywide plan called
                    Technology Vision 2020, which he described
                    as a road map for transforming India from
                    a less-developed to a developed society
                    in 20 years. The plan called for, among
                    other measures, increasing agricultural
                    productivity, emphasizing technology as
                    a vehicle for economic growth, and
                    widening access to health care and
                          education.</li>
